###### HOW TO RUN CODE #######

1. SETUP ENVIRONMENT: To run, first load any of the two .ipynb files in Google Colab or a local machine if all libraries are installed

2. LOAD DATA: The data was research data collected from an ASU research team "SHADE LAB". 
--> Open this link and download the data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ab6Tj2cBYPItaUNa75o2tgztnG7ztg9c?usp=sharing
--> Make sure to change directories in code accordingly, filenames have not been changed. 

3. RUN MODELS: At this stage, all cells can be run with no issues. 
--> Please note, in some cases, a user input is required. A brief explanation of the accepted inputs are printed. 
--> The notebook was already run and similar inputs can be followed to avoid confusion.
